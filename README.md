This repository demonstrates some less common runtime errors in Python that can be easily overlooked.  The `bug.py` file shows examples of floating-point exceptions (using infinity and NaN), OverflowError from exceeding floating-point limits, and RecursionError from excessive recursion.  The `bugSolution.py` file offers improved error handling, showing how to mitigate or prevent these issues.
